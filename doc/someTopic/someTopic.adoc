Here, we are in the documentation of some other topic. Let's see how we
can access the same resources as from the root page, this time with same
absolute or modified local links:

Normal use case: We address to some related stuff from the same topic:
link:https:relatedStuff/relatedStuff.html[^].

A root level document, as an example, of something which is outside of the
current sub-folder tree:

link:https:../../dummyHtmlDoc.html[^]

https://petervranken.github.io/dummyRepoToEvaluateGitPages/dummyHtmlDoc.html[^]

Here, we have a Doxygen example:

https://petervranken.github.io/dummyRepoToEvaluateGitPages/someApplication/doc/doxygen/html/globals_func.html

link:https:../../someApplication/doc/doxygen/html/globals_func.html[^]

link:https:../../someApplication/doc/doxygen/html/globals_func.html[^]

Here, we have a Javadoc example:

https://petervranken.github.io/dummyRepoToEvaluateGitPages/someJavaApplication/doc/dataModel/index.html[^]

link:https:../../someJavaApplication/doc/dataModel/index.html[^]
